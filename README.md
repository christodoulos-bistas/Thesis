This thesis focuses on two main areas. Initially, it involves bibliographic research, both through literature review and online exploration, to identify similar applications and their characteristics. 
It seeks to discover different image processing algorithms that can be implemented in an application, allowing users to adjust parameters and experiment with binary, 
grayscale or colored images based on specific criteria, which the user can also adjust. Lastly, it aims to find various methods and sources of input in an image processing application. 
The second involves developing the software application using the OpenCV library, offering a wide range of image processing functions.
Specifically, the application includes importing images of different types and resolutions, utilizing various methods and approaches.
It employs algorithms such as histogram processing, point processing, spatial and frequency domain filtering, image restoration, noise creation and removal, thresholding, and morphological image processing.
The application allows the creation of different image processing scenarios, where desired algorithms can be parametrically selected by the user for sequential execution on an image. 
Lastly, it provides automated image collection, modification, storage and deletion. Image processing can be performed on images in any format (binary, grayscale, colored). 
Choosing C++ for developing this application is justified due to its high performance and efficiency, enabling developers to create complex applications with high performance and functionality demands.
